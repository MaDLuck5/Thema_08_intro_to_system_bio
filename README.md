Authors: Mats Slik, Dennis Haandrikman

This github repository was used to learn about using ODE functionality in R studio and learn about creating a system biology model.
As can be seen in the folders Assignment 1-3 & Feedback_Orfeas_Dennis.


Next to that, this knowledge was used to recreate the model from a published scientific research paper.
In our case we opted to choose for the following paper: [The 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436518300070).

### Running the Project_madagascar code

To run the R-code made to generate the model & the data for our project.
Please download this github repository, make sure the directory encompassing everything from this github repositry is your working directory, then run "Madagascar_plague_model_document.rmd" in the Project_madagascar folder.
However, if the figures "Deterministic_Fig1.pdf" & "Stochastic_+_real_data_Fig2.pdf" aren't available, please run both .py scripts in the "Project_madagascar" folder.

If you just wish to look at the produced document and not run any of the files, please refer to "Madagascar_plague_model_document.pdf".
